<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
  <p>This week I am <em>extremely excited</em> about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide.</dfn> In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30.</time></p>
